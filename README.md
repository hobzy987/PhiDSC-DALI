# PhiDSC-DALI
PhiDsc, a novel statistical method developed based on the hypothesis that, functional mutations in a recurrently aberrant gene family can guide the identification of mutated residues in the familyâ€™s individual genes, with potential functional relevance. PhiDsc combines 3D structural alignment of related proteins with recurrence data for their mutated residues, to calculate the probability of randomness of the proposed mutation.
Run the result script put your desired protein name (UniProt name) 
run in UBUNTU and the dataset of mutations must be downloaded from (https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/prd//biomuta/content/biomuta-master.csv) and placed in the same directory
